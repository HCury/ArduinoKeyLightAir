# ArduinoKeyLightAir

This is a simple arduino project that takes the [Neewer 2 pack LED light pannels](https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Dimmable-Adjustable-Tabletop-Photography/dp/B07T8FBZC2/ref=sr_1_5?crid=26YM9YEI5JLXQ&keywords=neewer+led+light&qid=1690158795&sprefix=neewer+led+lig%2Caps%2C133&sr=8-5) and transforms it into a light that can be controlled via stream deck. 

## Todo:
1. Break the plastic control box attached to the wires
2. Take note of the postive cable that goes into the board
3. Connect your postive and negative to a Mosfet (REUSE BOTH SIDES OF THE CABLE!!)
4. Solder your MOSFET to your arduino (in this case I am using an ATTINY85).
5. Upload .ino code to your arduino
6. Make "Open" buttons for your stream deck that open up each individual batch file
